Assignment 2: Directions Part 1

Included Files:
    *server.cpp
    *heap.h
    *dijsktra.h
    *dijsktra.cpp
    *wdigraph.h
    *digraph.h
    *digraph.cpp
    *README
    *Makefile

Required files:
    edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt

Makefile Target:
    - make: Builds the project.
    - make server: Links all object files.
    - server.o & dijkstra.o & digraph.o: Compile the relevant objects.
    - make clean: Removes all object files and executables.

Running Instructions:
    1.In the directory containing all required files, open the terminal and enter
            $make
        to compile the code.
        Then enter
            $./server
        to run the project.
    2.  Firstly, the server builds the weighted directed graph and stores coordinates (i.e., latitude and longitude) of every vertex according to the file describing the road network of Edmonton ("edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt").

        Secondly, the server would be receiving and processing requests by reading from and writing to stdin and stdout, respectively.
        All requests will be made by simply providing a latitude and longitude (in 100,000-ths of degrees) of the start and end points in ASCII, separated by single spaces and terminated by a newline. The line should start with the character R.
        (e.g. R 5365486 -11333915 5364728 -11335891<\n>)

        The server would then process the request by first finding the closest vertices in the road map of Edmonton to the start and end points according to the Manhattan distance (breaking ties arbitrarily), next computing a shortest path along Edmonton streets between the two vertices found, and finally prints the number of way points (e.g. N 8<\n>) & found way points (e.g. W 5365488 -11333914<\n>) & end point indicator (e.g. E<\n>).
        Notice that the server would wait for an acknowledgment ("A<\n>") every time prints a line.

List of the code modified form the template:
    heap.h:
        template <-> modified file
        0a1,8
        3a12,13
        6a17,18
        17c29,31
        27c41,43
        33c49,73
        34a75,158

Notes and Assumptions:
    The server would process only one request.
    We didn't modify the wdigraph.h & digraph.h & digraph.cpp.
