Server Makefile Target:
    - make: Builds the project.
    - make server: Links all object files.
    - make server.o & dijkstra.o & digraph.o & server_util.o & server.o, & serialport.o: Compile the relevant objects.
    - make clean: Removes all object files and executables.

Running Instructions:
    1.  In the directory containing the client files, open the terminal and enter
            $make upload 
        to compile and run the client on the Arduino board.
    2.  In the directory containing the server files, open the terminal and enter
            $make
            $./server
        to compile the server software and run its executable file.

    3. The server will now communicate with the Arduino program when pushing its joystick button, by sending the cursor's coordinates to the server. Click at two different coordinate points to view the shortest path between them via road.
