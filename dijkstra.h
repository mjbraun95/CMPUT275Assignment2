/*
Compute least cost paths that start from a given vertex
Use a binary heap to efficiently retrieve an unexplored
vertex that has the minimum distance from the start vertex
at every iteration
PLI is an alias for "pair<long long, int>" type as discussed in class
PARAMETERS:
WDigraph: an instance of the weighted directed graph (WDigraph) class
startVertex: a vertex in this graph which serves as the root of the search tree
tree: a search tree used to construct the least cost path to some vertex
